Hello! My name is Tan Mei Yen and I am currently a second year student studying Computer Science at National University of Singapore. +

This Personal Project Portfolio details the contributions which I have made to the Equipment Manager project for CS2103T Software Engineering module. My main responsibilites is implementing command features and ensuring proper documentation.


== Project: `Equipment Manager`

---


:sectnums:
== Overview
_Equipment Manager_ is a desktop CLI (Command Line Interface) application that allows engineers to keep track on the Preventive Maintenance schedule of all Resuscitation Devices in Singapore. It has a GUI (Graphic User Interface) that allows users to get further information on each equipment. +

If you are an engineer that uses the computer frequently and want to improve efficiency at work, why not try out
https://github.com/CS2103-AY1819S2-W10-3/main/releases[_Equipment Manager_]? No installation is required!

Main Features of _Equipment Manager_:

* Viewing of equipment information through typing
* Searching and filtering by equipment serial number, equipment status or work list
* Display equipment location in Google Maps
* Plan the most efficient route to take for visiting multiple locations


== Summary of contributions
|===
|This section is to provide a summary of my contributions to the project.

'''

* *Major enhancements*: Implement filter feature to *filter the current shown list according to specified keywords*
** What it does: This feature allows the user to filter the current shown list which matches the given keywords:
*** Name
*** Address
*** Date
*** Phone
*** Tags
*** Serial Number

** Justification: The user can filter the current shown list with certain keywords, expediting the search process, and reducing the time needed to find a specific equipment or client.

** Highlights:
*** The command is simple to use and allows multiple keywords to filter by.
*** If users were to forget what are the fields/keywords available, error messages would guide them to execute the commands correctly.

* *Minor enhancement*: Implement sort feature to *sort the current shown list according to specified fields*
** What it does: This feature allows the user to sort the current shown list by the given fields:
*** Name
*** Address
*** Phone

** Justification: The user can sort the current shown list in lexicographical order for better viewing purposes.

** Highlights:
*** The command is simple to use and sort by.
